## Hi there! 👋 I'm @Alpha-RIM

👀 I'm a freshly minted data scientist passionate about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I recently switched my carrer to Data Science. I have a strong academic background in statistics, mathematics, and computer science(online courses and self learning), I'm eager to embark on an exciting journey in the field of data science and contribute my skills to solving real-world problems.


## 🚀 My Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, R
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning
- **Tools & Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Manipulation**: SQL, Pandas, Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau (basic)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
I'm constantly striving to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field of data science. Currently, I'm focusing on:

🔭 Exploring advanced Deep Learning architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers
Implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text data analysis
Understanding reinforcement learning algorithms for dynamic decision-making systems

##🔍 Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on:

### [Project 1: IPL score Prediction](https://github.com/Alpha-RIM/IPL_first_innings_score_prediction.git)
- Developed a prediction model using Machine learning regression techniques to predict the final score of the innings for a team.
- Performed data preprocessing, feature extraction,feature engineering and model training utilizing cross-validation methods to compare & optimize using Ridge & Lasso regression techniques.
- Deployed the model using Flask on Render. You can check out the deployed model [here](https://ipl-first-innings-score-prediction-rgqi.onrender.com/).

### [Project 2: Image Classification for Disease Detection in Chickens](https://github.com/Alpha-RIM/Chicken-Disease-Classification.git)
- Built a deep learning model for classifying chicken fecals as Coccidiosis or Healthy using transfer learning on pre-trained convolutional neural networks
- Implemented data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset
- Achieved an accuracy of 88% on the validation set, demonstrating the potential for assisting veteran in early detection.
